## Project Overview

This scientific calculator is a web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the COMP3207 Cloud Application Development module in my third year of computer science studies. It functions as a complete scientific calculator, performing all basic and advanced calculations, including:

* **Arithmetic operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus.
* **Trigonometric functions:** Sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant.
* **Inverse trigonometric functions:** Arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, arccotangent, arcsecant, and arcosecant.
* **Logarithmic functions:** Logarithm base 10 and natural logarithm.
* **Scientific functions:** Square root, factorial, absolute value, and random number generation.

## Technical Stack

* **Front-end:**
    * **JavaScript:** Primary programming language for logic and functionality.
    * **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the user interface.
    * **CSS:** Styling language for designing the user interface.
* **Optional:**
    * **JavaScript libraries:** Libraries like Math.js can extend mathematical functionalities.
* **Tools/Platforms**
    * **Git/Github**: Version control
    * **Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code**: Code development
    * **Microsoft Azure**: Cloud deployment

**This project demonstrates and enhances my ability to:**

* **Front-end development**: Design and develop web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **Mathematical problem-solving**: Implement complex mathematical calculations using Javascript libraries
* **User interface design**: Design user-friendly and responsive interfaces.
* **Cloud application development**: Deploy applications on cloud platforms.

## Possible Future Enhancements

* Implement complex scientific functions, such as integration and limits.
* Add graphing capabilities to visualize mathematical functions.
* Integrate with cloud storage for saved calculations and user accounts.
* Develop mobile app versions for iOS and Android.
